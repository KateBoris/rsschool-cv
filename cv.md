## About me
A humanitarian with a great desire to get into IT. I am sure that nothing is impossible, you just need to make an effort. I am able and like to work in a team, but sometimes it is easier for me to take responsibility and do the whole job myself.

## Code example
```
function removeChar(str){
  let i = 1;
  let result = '';
  for (;i < str.length - 1; i += 1) {
     if (str.length > 2) {
    result = `${result}${str[i]}`;
    }
  }   
  return result; 
};
```
